**Task:** Update the Service Areas page to add internal links to the two new location pages. This creates a hub-and-spoke structure for SEO.

**Files to edit:** The Service Areas page component (likely `app/service-areas/page.tsx` or a component it imports)

**Changes needed:**

## 1. In the Tuesday Pickup Section

Find where it lists "Franklin (unincorporated areas)" and add a link below the description:

```tsx
<a 
  href="/franklin-tn-garbage-pickup" 
  className="inline-block mt-2 text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 hover:underline font-medium"
>
  View Franklin Area Details →
</a>
```

## 2. Add a "Service by County" Section

After the "Weekly Trash Pickup Schedule by City" section, add a new section:

```tsx
{/* County Service Pages */}
<section className="mt-12">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Service by County</h2>
  <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
    <a 
      href="/williamson-county-trash-pickup"
      className="block p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow"
    >
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Williamson County</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
        Serving Leiper's Fork, Arno, College Grove, and unincorporated areas outside Franklin city limits.
      </p>
      <span className="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 font-medium">
        View Details →
      </span>
    </a>
    
    <a 
      href="/franklin-tn-garbage-pickup"
      className="block p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow"
    >
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Franklin TN Area</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
        Weekly Tuesday pickup for rural Franklin and surrounding Williamson County communities.
      </p>
      <span className="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 font-medium">
        View Details →
      </span>
    </a>
  </div>
</section>
```

## 3. Verify Internal Linking

After making changes, the Service Areas page should link to:
- `/franklin-tn-garbage-pickup`
- `/williamson-county-trash-pickup`

And both of those pages should link back to `/service-areas` (they already do in their content).

## Why This Matters

- No orphan pages (every page has internal links pointing to it)
- Hub-and-spoke structure helps Google understand site hierarchy
- Users can naturally discover location-specific content
- Passes link equity from the Service Areas page to the new pages

## After Making Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add internal links to Franklin and Williamson County pages"
git push
```
